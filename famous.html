            <p class="famousParagraph">400 B.C. Spartan soldiers use the scytale was the first ever military device used for cryptography and also the first recorded use of a transposition cipher or a cipher where the letters don’t change only their order. This wooden rod was used in conjunction with a strip of leather or parchment. 
                When the material with the encoded message was wrapped around the correct diameter rod the message was revealed  </p>

            <p class="famousParagraph">50 B.C. the Roman general and Dictator Julius Caesar states in his account of the Gallic wars he used a secret communication method known today as the Caesar Shift Cipher to message a fellow roman leader Cicero. 
                The Ceasar cipher was the first documented use of a substitution cipher or when each character is replaced with a different character. 
                The cipher simply replaced each letter with a letter three places down the alphabet. Influenced many other ciphers including the Vigenère Cipher.</p>

            <h2 class="famousTitle2">Zodiac Cipher</h2>
            <p class="famousParagraph">Possibly the most famous cipher was the one used by the Zodiac Killer in the late sixties into the early seventies. 
                The Zodiac killer is responsible for killing five people and injuring two more (these numbers can vary depending on who’s 
                account you accept) between December 1968 and 1969. The killer taunted authorities with a series of letters, four of which contained an encoded message. 
                The cover letter included in the messages demanded the messages be published causing an increase in public attention.
                 It wasn’t until a high school teacher Donald Harden and his wife Bettye cracked the first encoded message</p>

            <p class="famousParagraph">In the aftermath of the first world war, Germany sought a way to secure their communications to keep the allied nations from intercepting and decoded them. 
                Arthur Scherbius developed a machine that used a series of rotating disks or rotors each with 26 letters. After a key was pressed an electrical circuit was completed through the rotors scrambling the letters into an encrypted message. Polish cryptanalysts who 
                paved the way for mathematician Alan Turing and Bletchley Park they were able to develop machines like Bombe and crack the Enigma code</p>
