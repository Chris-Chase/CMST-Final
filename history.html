        <h2 class="historyTitle1">Ancient Cryptography</h2>
        <p class="historyParagraph1a"><span class="pTitle">Egypt (1900 BC)</span>: Early forms of cryptography appeared in Egypt with inscriptions in non-standard hieroglyphs used to encode messages on tombs and monuments.
            These were not necessarily secret codes but were intended to make the inscriptions appear more dignified.</p>
       <p class="historyParagraph1b"><span class="pTitle">Sparta (500 BC)</span>: Spartans used the scytale, a cylindrical tool that wrapped a strip of parchment around a baton to encode messages. 
           This ensured that only those with a matching baton could decode the message.</p>
        <p class="historyParagraph1c"><span class="pTitle">Julius Caesar (100 BC)</span>: The Caesar Cipher, a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet,
             was used to securely transmit military messages.</p>

                    this cipher used a keyword to determine the shift of letters in the plaintext, providing stronger encryption.</p>

        <p class="historyParagraph3a"><span class="pTitle">Enigma Machine (1918)</span> Developed by Arthur Scherbius, the Enigma Machine was used extensively by Germany during World War II. It utilized interchangeable rotors to encrypt messages. 
            However, it was eventually cracked by Polish codebreakers and British mathematician Alan Turing, significantly aiding the Allied war effort.</p>

                    It relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.</p>
