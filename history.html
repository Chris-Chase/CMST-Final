        <p class="historyParagraph1a"><span class="pTitle">Egypt (1900 BC)</span>: Early forms of cryptography appeared in Egypt with inscriptions in non-standard hieroglyphs used to encode messages on tombs and monuments.
            These were not necessarily secret codes but were intended to make the inscriptions appear more dignified.</p>
       <p class="historyParagraph1b"><span class="pTitle">Sparta (500 BC)</span>: Spartans used the scytale, a cylindrical tool that wrapped a strip of parchment around a baton to encode messages. 
           This ensured that only those with a matching baton could decode the message.</p>
        <p class="historyParagraph1c"><span class="pTitle">Julius Caesar (100 BC)</span>: The Caesar Cipher, a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet,
             was used to securely transmit military messages.</p>

                 <h3>Symmetric Algorithm</h3>
                 <p>Symmetric cryptography, or secret-key cryptography, uses the same key for both encryption and decryption of data. 
                    This means that the sender and the receiver must both have access to the same key, which must be kept secret from 
                    unauthorized parties. This works by having the plaintext encrypted with an algorithm and a secret key than with the
                     same key, decrypted back into plaintext.. Symmetric algorithms are usually faster and require less computational power
                      but with both parties needing the same key the system can become compromised if it is intercepted. </p>
                 <p>AES is used for bulk data encryption due to its speed and efficiency in encrypting large amounts of data with a single shared key.</p>
                 <p>EXAMPLES: <br> VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)<br>Wireless Network Security (WPA2)</p>

            <div class="asymmetric">
                <h3>Asymmetric Algorithm</h3>
                <p>Asymmetric cryptography, or public-key cryptography, uses two different keys,
                     a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Unlike symmetric, 
                     the keys are not identical, and the private key is always kept secret and never shared. 
                     Asymmetric eliminates the need to share a secret key. The public key can be shared freely, 
                     while the private key remains secure. Unlike symmetric, asymmetric algorithms are usually
                      slower and require more computer power, making them more difficult for encrypting large amounts of data. </p>
                <p>RSA is generally used for secure key exchange and digital signatures due to its ability to encrypt data with public/private key pairs.</p>
